                                          Brookstone Rover 2.0
-------------------------------------------------------
    1) To use this code you will need a Brookstone Rover 2.0
    2) Download the Source code into a local directory
    3) Open the code in your favorite python IDE i.e Pycharm or Spyder
    4) Turn on the Rover 2.0 and connect to the signal created by the rover. It will have a 
       name like ROVER_ID
    5) Run MPCR_RALVINN.py
    6) If done correctly you will see a live feed from the Rover 2.0 camera.
    7) Control the Rover 2.0 using:
        W - Forward
        S - Back
        D - Right
        A - LEFT
        J - Camera Up
        K - Camera Down
        I - Toggle Lights
        R - Neural Network
    8) Enjoy, have fun and help us by improving the code.
